Welcome to DiSARM Gears's documentation!
========================================

The disarm_gears package is as toolkit for spatial data analysis.
It was designed as a set of auxiliary functions for the
DiSARM API (see https://www.disarm.io/api/).
However, not all functions of the DiSARM API require the disarm_gears package.
